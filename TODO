- Fill test.pl with tests.
- More testing needed: style code has not been tested yet.
- Makes the return value of parse to an object (dTemplate::Scalar), which is a string ref, 
  for saving memory. Unfortunately this is not works.
- Possibility to pass a filehandle as a parse parameter, to instruct the system to use it 
  for output, instead of using the return value. This saves several string copy in the memory.
