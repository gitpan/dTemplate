The dTemplate compiled data has the following format:

- number of variables in this template [ I32 ]
- variable-hash [ 0-terminated string ]
    - The hash-keys (variable names) are separated by spaces and stored as one
      null-terminated string. The hash-key lookup is done by sequential scan
- variable name => id table [ determined sized ]
    - This table has exactly the same length as the previous null-terminated
      string. After the lookup is done in the previous table, you can use the
      same index in this table to lookup the code of the variable.
- template chunks [ * ]
    - chunk text size [ I32 ]
    - chunk text [ determined size ]
    - if not the last chunk:
	- full matched string, including delimiters [ 0-terminated ]
	- variable ID [ I32 ]
	- variable path in qualified variable [ \0 terminated list ] (including variable name also)
	    - variable path part [ \0 terminated strings ]
	- encoder list [ \0 terminated list ]
	    - encoder [ \0 terminated string ]
	    - encoder parameter [ \0 terminated string ]
	- printf format string [ \0 terminated string ]
    - last chunk:
	- \0
